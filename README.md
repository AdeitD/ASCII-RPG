# Role-Playing-Game
Hi there! This is an ASCII-based RPG game I created a few years ago as a summative assessment for a secondary school Computer Science class. The background music file was too large to upload, but if you're interested in playing with music, search up "Playing Adventure-Uplifting [Monsterca, NCS]" on YouTube.
